The problem with today's platforms:
</p>

<p>
They can change out from under you at any time.
The users that benefit the most from platforms are the users that can serve the needs of the platform owners the best
The platform owners are not necessarily users so their needs to do not likely align with the users needs but rather the need to turn a profit
